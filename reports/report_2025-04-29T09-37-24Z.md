## Analysis Summary

{'analysis': '## 1. Overall Match Score\n- The overall match score is 20%.\n- This low score is due to the CV lacking specific technical skills and experiences directly mentioned in the job description, such as hands-on experience with Java, Angular, and AWS, despite the candidate having a strong background in technology and project management.\n- The candidate\'s experience and skills, although impressive in their own right, do not closely align with the specific requirements outlined for the Software Developer/Cloud DevOps position.\n\n## 2.

Section-by-Section Suggestions\n- **Summary/Profile:** Rephrase to highlight any relevant technical skills or experiences that could be applied to software development and cloud DevOps, even if not directly mentioned.
